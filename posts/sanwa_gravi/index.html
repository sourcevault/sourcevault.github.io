Having tried a couple of different trackballs, the one I am currently using is the Sanwa Gravi, made by Elecom from Japan 🇯🇵. It is one of the better ones I have used, espcially if you replace the stock bearing with a ceremic one.\nPrior to using the Gravi, I had been using the Elecom Huge Trackball for about 5 years. The reason for buying a new one was that the scrollwheel on the Elecom Huge finally broke. Since I only had one trackball, and did not like using a mouse, I had to find something as good as the Huge. As a power computer user, this problem required urgent attention.\nAt this time, due to its greater fanfare, the only alternative that was on my radar was the Ploopy Classic Trackball. If I did not find out about the Sanwa Gravi, this review would probably be about the ploopy instead. The price of the ploopy was exorbitant at around $162, the shipping cost alone was something like 70$. The Sanwa Gravi on the other hand was $86 - including shipping. Making a choice between them without having tried either of the trackballs was risky. The decision became easier when I considered how important portability was for my workflow, and for that, I needed something wireless, which the Ploopy did not offer.\nThe first thing I noticed on the Gravi was how much better the scroll wheel was compared to the Elecom, maybe having used a broken scroll-wheel for so long makes you appreciate when you have a good one. Soon enough however, I was left with a sense of alarm as the stock bearing seems to have serious issues with traction. It was concerning enough that I assumed it was a faulty unit and had it returned for a replacement one. After about 2 weeks of waiting, I was dissapointed again as the second unit turned out to have the same issue with the bearing.\nFor the time being I accepted my fate, as there was no other good options around. The Sanwa Gravi, afterall, did not exist when I first purchased my Elecom Huge. Maybe I just have to cross my fingers and wait for some company somewhere to release something better.\n› Elecom Huge comes with 8 programmable buttons and I used them enough to damage all of them. Unfortunately, for the time being, there are no other similarily designed alternatives built with better components. Note the level of wear and tear on the Elecom; it had a good run and provided good service.\rThe Elecom Huge was perfect in every way when I bought it, except for the fact that the scroll wheel and buttons were made of poor components. It's not initially noticeable, unless you try better quality ones, like the Gravi. Now, when I use my Elecom Huge, the buttons feel like something you find in cheap toys as compared to the Gravi.\rThe bearing on the Elecom Huge itself had no issues; unlike the Gravi, the stock bearing was good enough to not attract any negative attention. There are DIY videos online where people change the stock Elecom Huge bearing, but I never felt the need to do it. The Gravi on the other hand, comes with awful stock bearing - something had to be done about it.\nWith doing hardware related do-it-yourself things like this, there is always a worry that something might break, espcially since I just purchased it brand new. I have documented the entire process for changing the bearing below, in case you need to do it. Long story short, it was much easier than I anticipated and I did not break the trackball.\nA few reddit threads had me convinced steel bearing was smoother, so I ordered steels ones too, but it did not turn out to be better than ceramic ones.\nPast Mouses Model Current Price ($) 1 3M™ Wireless Ergonomic Mouse, Small, EM550GPS 100 2 R.A.T. 8+ 100 3 Perimice ~ 20 4 Elecom Deft M-DT1URBK 51 5 Microsoft Sculpt 60 › List of ergonomic mouses and trackball I have used going back half a decade.\rThe first three on the list were quite useless; I did not use them for more than a few weeks. I was suffering from Repetitive Strain Injury during this period, and any discomfort, and the mouse would go to the storage box, if you notice, my choices were based on different designs, I was interested in trying out unorthodox input devices, more than buying better versions of the same design.\nThe ones I liked and used was the Elecom Deft and Microsoft Sculpt. Because of how good the Elecom Deft was, it made me buy the Elecom Huge.\nI would like to leave with a video on how far you can customize your mouse and keyboard, I must be quite close to what is ideal.\nWhat Next ? The Sanwa Supply will one day stop working - just like the Elecom Huge, what to do then ? the most we can hope for is the trackball market to keep on experimenting with better designs - the more buttons the better; perhaps one with mechnical switches, you never know. While putting together this article, I stumbled upon the ProtoArc EM03 Wireless Bluetooth , it seems quite good and similar to the Sanwa Supply at half the price, but maybe the components are made of cheaper material; who knows ? I am not willing to take the risk until I have to.\nChanging Stock Bearing In this section I have provided information on how I changed the stock bearing on the Gravi:\n› zirconia (ZrO₂) 2.0 mm ceremic ball bearing (2.5 mm does not fit).\rThe first thing you need to do is get your hands on the replacement bearing; I generally use AliExpess but you can find them on other ecommerce outlets too.\r› you need a screw driver and Tweezers before you start.\r› There are 5 screws holding the base plate, you need to remove them all.\rMost of the screws are hidden below the rubber on the surface of the base plate, gently remove them first. If the glue is not removed or damaged then you should not have a problem putting it back on after you are done.\r› When removing the controller attached to the base plate, the internal plastic buttons will come off and fall somewhere, either inside the trackball or if you are unlucky - on the floor. This is where the tweezers come in handy, you need to be delicate with them, to avoid causing any damage.\r› The cup holding the trackball has to be bought out of the trackball housing, there are three small screws holding it.\rThe base plate can be rotated to reveal all the relevant component parts, but you have to do it slowly and ensure that you do not damage all the internal connections.\n› Overall the task required removing 11 screws.\r› The bearings is protected by a circular plastic casing held in place by three latches. You have to use your nails and three fingers to open it.\rWhen you remove the controller connected to the ball holder, a small piece of transparent plastic cube will come off, you will need to put it back up during reassembly, it is part of the optical sensor.\n› This is the trackball bearing, you have to push it from the inside using the tweezer to unhook it, make sure there is a container below to prevent it from falling onto the floor.\r› The base plate has a controller attached to it, during the reasssmbly process you have to be very careful with the plastic buttons, especially the on/off switch on the right. This took the longest time and had to be done multiple times to get right.\rPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\rcomments powered by Disqus\r",

<p>People who know me would tell you that I am a big fan of trackball as a replacement for using a mouse. <a href="#past-mouses">Having tried a couple of different trackballs</a>, the one I am currently using is the Sanwa Gravi, made by Elecom from Japan 🇯🇵.

 › List of ergonomic mouses and trackball I have used going back half a decade.
</center>
<br>
<p>The first three on the list were quite useless; I did not use them for more than a few weeks. I was suffering from Repetitive Strain Injury during this period, and any discomfort, and the mouse would go to the storage box, if you notice, my choices were based on <strong>different</strong> designs, I was interested in trying out unorthodox input devices, more than buying better versions of the same design.</p>
<p>The ones I liked and used was the Elecom Deft and Microsoft Sculpt. Because of how good the Elecom Deft was, it made me buy the Elecom Huge.</p>
<p>I would like to leave with a video on how far you can customize your mouse and keyboard, I must be quite close to what is ideal.</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What Next ?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-next-">#</a></h3>
<p>The Sanwa Supply will one day stop working - just like the Elecom Huge, what to do then ? the most we can hope for is the trackball market to keep on experimenting with better designs - the more buttons the better; perhaps one with mechnical switches, you never know. While putting together this article, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.protoarc.com/products/em03-trackball-mouse">ProtoArc EM03 Wireless Bluetooth </a>, it seems quite good and similar to the Sanwa Supply at half the price, but maybe the  components are made of cheaper material; who knows ? I am not willing to take the risk until I have to.</p>

<p>In this section I have provided information on how I changed the stock bearing on the Gravi:</p>

 › zirconia (ZrO₂) 2.0 mm ceremic ball bearing (2.5 mm does not fit).
</center>
<br>
The first thing you need to do is get your hands on the replacement bearing; I generally use AliExpess but you can find them on other ecommerce outlets too.

<center>
 › There are 5 screws holding the base plate, you need to remove them all.
 Most of the screws are hidden below the rubber on the surface of the base plate, gently remove them first. If the glue is not removed or damaged then you should not have a problem putting it back on after you are done.

<center>
 › When removing the controller attached to the base plate, the internal plastic buttons <b> will come off </b> and fall somewhere, either inside the trackball or if you are unlucky - on the floor. This is where the tweezers come in handy, you need to be delicate with them, to avoid causing any damage.

<center>
 › The cup holding the trackball <b>has to be bought out of the trackball housing</b>, there are <b>three</b> small screws holding it.
</center>
<p>The base plate <i>can be rotated</i> to reveal all the relevant component parts, but you have to do it <b>slowly</b> and ensure that you do not damage all the internal connections.</p>

  › The bearings is protected by a circular plastic casing held in place by three latches. You have to use your nails and <b>three</b> fingers to open it.
</center>
<br>
<p>When you remove the controller connected to the ball holder, a small piece of transparent plastic cube will come off, you will need to put it back up during reassembly, it is part of the optical sensor.</p>

  › This is the trackball <b>bearing</b>, you have to push it from the inside using the tweezer to unhook it, make sure there is a container below to prevent it from falling onto the floor.

  › The base plate has a controller attached to it, during the reasssmbly process you have to be <i>very careful with the plastic buttons</i>, especially the <b>on/off switch on the right</b>. This took the longest time and had to be done multiple times to get right.
